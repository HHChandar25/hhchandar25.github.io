                Every programmer has a unique story of how they started coding. Mine began with curiosity and evolved into a genuine passion for creating digital solutions. From my first "Hello World" to building functional applications, this journey has been filled with challenges, breakthroughs, and countless hours of learning.

            <h2>The Beginning: HTML and CSS</h2>
            <p>
                My programming journey started in secondary school when I stumbled upon a basic web development tutorial. I was fascinated by the idea that I could write text in a file and somehow create a webpage that others could see. My first HTML page was incredibly simple‚Äîjust a heading and a paragraph‚Äîbut seeing it display in a browser felt magical.
            </p>

            <div class="code-block" data-language="html">
<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My First Website&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my first webpage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code>
            </div>

            <p>
                Soon after, I discovered CSS and the power of styling. Suddenly, my plain black text on white background could have colors, fonts, and layouts. I spent hours experimenting with different styles, creating rainbow gradients and animated hover effects. It was like discovering I could paint with code.
            </p>

            <h2>JavaScript: The Game Changer</h2>
            <p>
                Learning JavaScript was a pivotal moment in my programming journey. For the first time, I could make my websites truly interactive. I remember the excitement of creating my first function that responded to user input‚Äîa simple temperature converter that switched between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
            </p>

            <div class="code-block" data-language="javascript">
<code>function convertTemperature(temp, unit) {
    if (unit === 'celsius') {
        return (temp * 9/5) + 32; // Convert to Fahrenheit
    } else {
        return (temp - 32) * 5/9; // Convert to Celsius
    }
}

// Example usage
const celsius = 25;
const fahrenheit = convertTemperature(celsius, 'celsius');
console.log(`${celsius}¬∞C is ${fahrenheit}¬∞F`);</code>
            </div>

            <p>
                JavaScript taught me about programming logic, variables, functions, and control structures. I built increasingly complex projects: a todo list app, a memory game, and even a basic weather app that fetched data from an API. Each project pushed me to learn something new.

            <h2>Python: A New Perspective</h2>
            <p>
                After becoming comfortable with front-end technologies, I wanted to explore server-side programming. Python became my gateway into backend development, data processing, and automation. Its clean syntax and powerful libraries opened up new possibilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of my favorite Python projects was a file organizer script that automatically sorted my downloads folder by file type and date. It was a simple but practical solution that saved me hours of manual work.
            </p>

            <div class="code-block" data-language="python">
<code>import os
import shutil
from datetime import datetime

def organize_files(source_folder):
    for filename in os.listdir(source_folder):
        if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(source_folder, filename)):
            file_extension = filename.split('.')[-1].lower()
            
            # Create folder for file type if it doesn't exist
            type_folder = os.path.join(source_folder, file_extension.upper())
            if not os.path.exists(type_folder):
                os.makedirs(type_folder)
            
            # Move file to appropriate folder
            source = os.path.join(source_folder, filename)
            destination = os.path.join(type_folder, filename)
            shutil.move(source, destination)
            
    print("Files organized successfully!")

            <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
            <p>
                My programming journey is far from over. Technology evolves rapidly, and there's always something new to learn. Currently, I'm excited about exploring:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Machine Learning and AI applications</li>
                <li>Mobile app development</li>

            </ul>

            <p>
                What started as curiosity about how websites work has evolved into a genuine passion for solving problems through code. Every day brings new challenges and opportunities to grow. The best part about programming is that there's always more to discover, more to build, and more ways to make a positive impact through technology.
