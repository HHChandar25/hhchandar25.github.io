                Choosing a career path is one of the most significant decisions we make in our lives. For me, the journey to selecting HBO-ICT at HZ University of Applied Sciences wasn't just about following a trend or picking something that seemed profitable‚Äîit was about discovering where my natural curiosities and skills could make the biggest impact.
            </p>

            <h2>The Spark of Interest</h2>
            <p>
                My fascination with technology began early, but it wasn't just about playing games or browsing the internet. I found myself constantly wondering how things worked behind the scenes. Why did some websites load faster than others? How did mobile apps know my location? What made some software intuitive while others felt clunky?
            </p>

            <p>
                These questions led me down rabbit holes of exploration. I started tinkering with basic HTML and CSS, creating simple websites just to see if I could make them look the way I imagined. Each small success‚Äîgetting a button to change color when hovered over, making a responsive layout work‚Äîfelt like solving a puzzle that mattered.

            <h2>The Decision-Making Process</h2>
            <p>
                When it came time to choose my higher education path, I knew I wanted something that combined problem-solving, creativity, and practical application. I researched various programs and universities, but HZ University of Applied Sciences stood out for several reasons:

            <h2>Activities That Shaped My Choice</h2>
            <p>
                Several key experiences confirmed that ICT was the right path for me:
            </p>

            <h3>Coding Bootcamp Participation</h3>
            <p>
                During my final year of secondary school, I participated in a weekend coding bootcamp focused on web development. Over two intense days, I learned the basics of JavaScript and built my first interactive web application‚Äîa simple calculator. The feeling of writing code that actually did something useful was addictive.
            </p>

            <div class="code-block" data-language="javascript">
                <code>function calculate(operation, a, b) {
                    switch(operation) {
                        case '+': return a + b;
                        case '-': return a - b;
                        case '*': return a * b;
                        case '/': return b !== 0 ? a / b : 'Error';
                        default: return 'Invalid operation';
                    }
                }</code>
            </div>

            <h3>Tech Meetup Attendance</h3>
            <p>
                I started attending local tech meetups in Zeeland, where I met working professionals from various ICT fields. Hearing their stories about solving real business problems through technology, building applications that thousands of people use, and continuously learning new skills convinced me that this was an industry where I could grow and make a meaningful contribution.
            </p>

            <h3>Open Days and University Visits</h3>
            <p>
                Visiting HZ University during their open day was a turning point. I spoke with current students and professors, toured the facilities, and participated in mini-workshops. The energy and enthusiasm of everyone I met was infectious. It felt like a place where curiosity was valued and innovation was encouraged.
            </p>

            <h2>My Vision for the Future</h2>
            <p>
                After completing my HBO-ICT degree, I envision myself working in a role where I can bridge the gap between technology and user experience. Whether that's as a software developer creating intuitive applications, a systems analyst optimizing business processes, or even starting my own tech company, I want to be part of solutions that make people's lives easier and more connected.

            <p>
                The ICT field is unique in its potential for impact. Every line of code written, every system designed, and every problem solved through technology has the potential to reach and help thousands or even millions of people. That's the kind of work that excites me‚Äîwork that matters.
